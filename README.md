# ShellDuo
Xamarin Shell Template with Dual Screen Support

The highlights of what is changed in this example are:

1. Extends the BaseViewModel with Screen aware functionality.
2. Combines the ItemsViewModel and ItemDetailViewModel.
3. Moves the ItemDetailPage functionality into ItemDetailView.
4. Adds the TwoPaneView control to ItemsPage.
